gitmirror
=========

This role installs and sets up a git mirror server ( https://github.com/beefsack/git-mirror )

Requirements
------------

This module has only been developed and tested on CentOS 7. It ought to work on any Linux distro that uses systemd.

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

Does not depend on any other roles.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: username.rolename, x: 42 }
